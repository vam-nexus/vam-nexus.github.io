                            <p>In our daily work, programmers increasingly rely on AI chatbots to assist with coding tasks. These tools make us more productive by providing quick answers to our programming questions, eliminating the need to search for an expert or sift through documentation.</p>
                            <p>Previously, if we were stuck with a programming task or unsure what to do next, we might have had to find an expert to ask. This process could take time, finding someone available, explaining the issue, and waiting for a response. However, now, whenever we have a question, we can ask an AI chatbot and get an answer immediately.</p>
                            <p>For this course, we've provided a chatbot that allows us to type our programming questions, also known as prompts, directly into it. While we have this chatbot available, feel free to use third-party chatbots like ChatGPT, Microsoft Copilot, Anthropic Claude, or Google Gemini for additional help.</p>

                            <h2>Understanding Prompts and Responses</h2>
                            <p>When using a chatbot for coding, the text we enter is called a <strong>prompt</strong>, and the chatbot's answer is known as a <strong>completion</strong>.</p>
                            <p>For example, if we type the prompt:</p>
                            <pre><code class="language-python"><strong>What is Python?</strong></code></pre>
                            <p>The chatbot responds:</p>
                            <pre><code class="language-python"><strong>"Python is a high-level programming language that is easy to read and write, making it a great choice for beginners."</strong></code></pre>
                            <p>If we want to learn more about syntax, we can enter:</p>
                            <pre><code class="language-python"><strong>"What does syntax mean?"</strong></code></pre>
                            <p>The chatbot will then generate an explanation, helping us grasp the fundamental concepts of coding more quickly.</p>
                            <p>We can also ask follow-up questions if something isn't clear. This workflow, asking questions, receiving answers, and refining our understanding, is an approach that even experienced developers use when learning new programming concepts.</p>

                            <p>A common starting point in programming is writing the <strong>"Hello, World!"</strong> program. Traditionally, new programmers begin their journey by writing a simple program that prints "Hello, World!" to the screen.</p>
                            <p>Let's ask ChatGPT:</p>
                            <pre><code class="language-python"><strong>"What is the first program traditionally written by brand-new programmers?"</strong></code></pre>
                            <p>ChatGPT responds:</p>
                            <p><em>"The simple program traditionally written by beginners is the 'Hello, World!' program. This program displays the text 'Hello, World!' on the screen."</em></p>
                            <p>Now, let's use ChatGPT to write this program for us. We type the prompt:</p>
                            <pre><code class="language-python"><strong>"Write a Python program to print 'Hello, World!'"</strong></code></pre>

                            <p>One powerful feature of ChatGPT is its ability to modify code. Suppose we want our program to say hello to us by name instead of "Hello, World!".</p>
                            <p>We can prompt ChatGPT:</p>
                            <p><strong>"Modify the code to say hello to me instead of the world. My name is Andrew."</strong></p>

                            <p>We ask ChatGPT:</p>
                            <p><strong>"Write some code to calculate how many days there are between Christmas (December 25th) and my birthday (April 18th) in a non-leap year."</strong></p>

# Define dates
christmas = date(2025, 12, 25)

                            <p>Google Colab is a free, cloud-based platform that allows you to write and execute Python code through your browser. It's a powerful tool for learning and developing AI applications. Here's how to get started:</p>
                            <p>In Google Colab, code is organized into cells. Each cell can contain Python code, text, or markdown. To run a cell, click the play button next to the cell or press Shift + Enter.</p>

                            For example, you might prompt ChatGPT with the following: <pre><code class="language-python"><strong>"Modify the code in this cell to print a poem instead of 'hello world'."</strong></code></pre></p>
                            <p>You might get a poem like this: <pre><code class="language-python">print("Twinkle, twinkle, little star,
How I wonder what you are!
Up above the world so high,
Like a diamond in the sky.")

                            <p style="background: #F3F4F6; padding: 0.5rem; border-radius: 0.25rem;">Copy the python code with the poem from ChatGPT and paste it back into the cell under "## Poem Code" and execute it. <strong>"## Another Code that Doesn't Work :( :( "</strong> which has an error in order to debug it, and then run it</p>

Just as with learning a new spoken language, you may not get everything right the first time, and that is okay! Instead of getting frustrated, use errors as learning opportunities.</p>
